## Project Notes

My goal for this project is to create and ship a 'complete' game, and to explore using components vs inheritance in my high-level structure.

## Future Features:

- Character Selection
- Save volume/sfx/screen mode preferences
- Add new enemy types
- Add new upgrades (both meta and normal)
- Rework wizard enemy type with ranged attack
- Add new movement type so ranged enemies only move close enough to player to stay in attack range.
- Add floating damage text
