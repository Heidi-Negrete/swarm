# Project Notes

ECS

# To Dos:

Bugfix: in web build options_menu does not update label with WINDOW_MODE  
Bugfix: mobs can still get stuck in upper limits of tilemap
Bugfix: axe's are spawning exponentially faster over course of game (also tune to slower base rate)

Add range attack in wizard enemy type  
Add new movement type in velocity component accelerate_to_in_range so wizard only moves toward player enough to stay in range for attack.  
Fix xp, currently anything above what is needed to lvl is lost and not used.
Add floating damage text?

Update this README with up-to-date screenshots of gameplay
