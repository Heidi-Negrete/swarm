# Project Notes

ECS

# To Dos:

Add range attack in wizard enemy type  
Add new movement type in velocity component accelerate_to_in_range so wizard only moves toward player enough to stay in range for attack.  
all xp above what is needed to lvl is lost and not used.  
alter the hurt flash on player to RED not white?  
add animation to the lose/win  
add a scary 'throbbing' dark red ColorRect over screen when player health is < certain amount
