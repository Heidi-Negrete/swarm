## Project Notes

My goal for this project was to explore using components vs inheritance in my high-level structure.

## Future Features:

- Rework wizard enemy type with ranged attack
- Add new movement type in velocity component accelerate_to_in_range so ranged enemies only move toward player enough to stay in range for attack.
- Add floating damage text

## Bugs:
